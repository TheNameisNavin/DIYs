# Arduino Projects Collection
Welcome to my Arduino Projects Collection, where I share my experiments, prototypes, and fully functional projects built using Arduino. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, you'll find a variety of projects covering different applications, including IoT, robotics, automation, and sensor-based systems.

About This Repository
This repository serves as a personal archive of my Arduino-based projects, including:

Circuit diagrams
Source codes
Component lists
Explanations of the working principle
Each project is well-documented to help you understand the concept, replicate it, or modify it for your own needs.

To run these projects, youâ€™ll need:

An Arduino board (Uno, Mega, Nano, ESP8266, ESP32, etc.)
Arduino IDE (for compiling and uploading code)
Necessary libraries
Basic electronic components

If you have suggestions, improvements, or new project ideas, feel free to:

Fork this repository
Submit a pull request
Report issues or bugs
I'm always open to collaboration and learning from the community.
